# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! This repository showcases my data cleaning, exploration, visualization, API integration, web scraping, and analysis skills using various tools, such as Python, R, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

## Projects

### [Analyzing Tesla's Historical Stock-Revenue Data](https://github.com/ReemSaeedMetwally/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Analyzing%20Tesla's%20Historical%20Stock-Revenue%20Data)
- **Description**: This project analyzes Tesla’s historical stock prices and revenue trends to understand its financial performance. The data is extracted using Yahoo Finance for stock prices and web scraping (BeautifulSoup) for Tesla's quarterly revenue. The project visualizes the relationship between stock price movements and revenue trends using interactive Plotly graphs.  
The analysis aims to:
  * Compare Tesla’s stock price fluctuations with its revenue growth.
  * Identify trends, volatility, and key events affecting Tesla's valuation.
  * Provide insights into how stock performance aligns with Tesla's fundamental financials.
- **Skills**: Data extraction, API Integration, Web Scraping, Data cleaning, Data Visualization.
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, yfinance, Requests, BeautifulSoup, Plotly)

### [Automobile Price Prediction](https://github.com/ReemSaeedMetwally/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Automobile%20Price%20Prediction)
- **Description**: This project aims to predict car prices based on various features such as engine type, horsepower, mileage, and other vehicle specifications with high accuracy. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, implementing multiple machine learning models, optimizing hyperparameters using GridSearchCV, and validating models with cross-validation. By comparing the models’ performance using metrics such as R² score, achieving R² score of 0.90 with the best-performing model.
- **Skills**: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, Machine Learning Models: Regression Models, Model Optimization, Model Evaluation
- **Tools Used**:
  * Programming Languages: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn)
  * Machine Learning: scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Ridge, Random Forest, Cross-Validation)
  * Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * Data Processing: pandas, NumPy
 
### [Uber Data Analysis Dashboard]()
- **Description**: This project presents a full Power BI dashboard analyzing Uber ride data from 2016. The goal was to uncover patterns in user behavior, trip timing, distance, and purpose to support business decisions. The process included detailed ETL using Power Query (data cleaning, formatting, forward fill, unit conversion), followed by feature engineering (time-of-day categories, duration calculations). Interactive visuals enabled dynamic filtering by location, date, and time. Key findings supported actionable insights in driver allocation, trip category trends, and demand forecasting.
- **Skills**: ETL with Power Query, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Dashboard Design, Business Insight Extraction, KPI Reporting, Story-telling.
- **Tools Used**:
  * Power BI: Data Modeling, Power Query, DAX, Visual Design
  * Business Intelligence Concepts: Filtering, Slicers, Trend Analysis

### [Diamonds Data Analysis](https://github.com/ReemSaeedMetwally/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/main/Diamonds%20Data%20Analysis)
- **Description**: This project analyzes the Diamonds dataset to explore factors affecting diamond prices. It applies data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling to uncover insights into how cut, clarity, carat, and other features influence diamond pricing. The project uses tidyverse and ggplot2 for data manipulation & visualization, along with regression modeling to predict prices.
- **Skills**: Data wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data visualization, Statistical analysis & hypothesis testing, Regression modeling
- **Tools Used**: R programming, tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr), ggplot2 for data visualization, lm() for regression modeling, RStudio as the development environment
